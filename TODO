TODO

* Check for unknown keys in subfiglist package options
* Check if new method of choice key setting works with older l3keys
* Use \subfiglist_token_if_eq_charcode:NN to compare \\ with \\.
* Test all error messages
* Use sequences in place of token lists
* Delete unnecessary variables
* Replace test for equal charcode by test for equal charcode AND equal meaning
* Add change of meaning for `@' depending on catcode to known issues. Weird settings of catcodes e.g. for numbers may have strange effects
* Remove \subfiglist_test_conditionals:
* \subfiglist_tokenize_spec_str:VN -> \subfiglist_tokenize_spec_str:NV
* Set \subfiglist_spec_canvas_nums by dependency injection
* tempa -> tmpa in accordance with kernel docs
* Replace wrapping commands by more general \subfiglist_tl_set_wrapped in parser and lexer
* Add logging of canvas numbers to \subfiglist_setup_file:nnn
* Remove need for xstring package?
* Add starred commands for dummy/dummyfile to add frame
* Rewrite error messages for int/float as "expected integer, found ... instead"
* Replace any \cs in error messages by \tl_to_str:c { cs }



DONE

* Rewrite \subfiglist_tl_if_eq_charcode:nn to actually compare charcodes
* Use working \subfiglist_tl_if_eq_charcode:nn in \subfiglist_is_float_or_empty to detect decimal separator.
* Remove \subfiglist_exp_args:NNt from \subfiglist_is_float_or_empty
* Maybe replace \use:c by \cs_if_exist_use:cF and throw an error message in false part
* For token list conditionals, check for length equal to 1 and do not pass tail, if true. Makes ..._or_empty functions obsolete.
* Make use of \tl_if_head_is_space in token list conditionals & revert to _or_empty versions of tl conditionals
* Add \subfiglist_tl_if_eq_charcode and employ in lexer functions
